# NOTE: heavy ML packages are moved to `requirements-ml.txt` so serverless
# builders (like Vercel) won't attempt to build large wheels during deployment.
# Keep only lightweight runtime packages here.
# If you need to install ML packages locally or on a dedicated ML host, use
# `pip install -r backend/requirements-ml.txt`.
# Ensure setuptools is installed so packages expecting distutils can find it
